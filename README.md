# SAM-2

SAM 2 by Meta is an object segmentation model for both images and videos. It's unified model architecture excels in handling visual data and supports real-time processing and zero-shot generalization.

I tried a small project where I segmented a small portion of the video of athelete Neeraj Chopra throwing a javeline using SAM 2.
